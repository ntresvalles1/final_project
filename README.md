## Intro to Data Science Final Project
With the increase in bicycle trails in New York City in 2019, after there was an increase in cycling deaths, we wanted our analysis to focus on the data surrounding this decision. The new "Green Wave" proposal's goal is to increase the number of protected bike lane miles annually. 

Thus, our project uses cloropleth maps, leaflets, and data wrangling to analyze bicycle accidents in the different boroughs of New York City. It also examines further implications of the data provided by the city.
